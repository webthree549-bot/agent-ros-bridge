---

## Phase 1: Architecture Design (Day 1)

### 1.1 Design Document

### 1.2 Interface Definitions
```python
# Core integration points:

class Bridge:
    # Existing
    - transports: TransportManager
    - connectors: ConnectorManager
    
    # NEW for v0.5.0
    - memory: AgentMemory
    - safety: SafetyManager  
    - tools: ToolDiscovery
    - langchain: LangChainAdapter
    - autogpt: AutoGPTAdapter
    - mcp: MCPServerTransport

## Success Metrics

| Metric | v0.4.1 | v0.5.0 Target |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Working AI Features | 0 | 6+ |
| Test Coverage | ~30% | 80%+ |
| Documentation | Partial | Complete |
| Integration Tests | 0 | 5+ |
| Examples | 3 | 8+ |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Integration complexity | Start with simple adapter pattern |
| Test coverage gaps | TDD - write tests first |
| Documentation lag | Document as you code |
| Scope creep | Strict 2-week deadline |

---

## Vision Statement

**v0.5.0 will be the release we wish v0.4.0 was.**

- Every claimed feature works
- Every feature has tests
- Every feature has documentation
- No orphaned code
- No false claims
