## Agent ROS Bridge - Major Release Day

### Releases Completed

**v0.3.0 - Security-First Major Release**
- Removed mock mode entirely
- JWT authentication now always required (no bypass)
- Docker-only examples for isolated testing
- Default bind changed to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
- Breaking changes from v0.2.x

**v0.3.1 - Documentation Consistency Fix**
- Removed all "mock" terminology from user-facing docs
- Renamed files: mock_bridge.py → simulated_robot.py
- Fixed SKILL.md - removed non-functional "commands" section
- Updated all README files for clarity
- Consistent terminology across all files

### ClawHub Submission Journey

**Initial Status:** "Suspicious high confidence"
- Issues: mock mode confusion, auth bypass concerns, metadata inconsistencies

**After Fixes:** "Benign medium confidence" ✅
- Mock mode completely removed
- JWT_SECRET consistently required
- Docker-focused examples
- Clear security model

**Key Lesson:** ClawHub values consistency and clear security boundaries. The "commands" section in SKILL.md doesn't work as expected - better to document usage patterns in README.

### Project Statistics

- **Code:** ~8,000 lines
- **Documentation:** 40,000+ words
- **Git Commits:** 40+
- **GitHub Stars:** Growing
- **PyPI Downloads:** Active

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Security-First:** No auth bypass, ever
2. **Docker-First Examples:** Isolated testing without compromising security
3. **JWT Always Required:** Bridge fails to start without JWT_SECRET
4. **Localhost Default:** Safe defaults, explicit opt-in for external exposure

### Next Steps

- Monitor ClawHub submission status
- Community adoption tracking
- Future: VLA (Vision-Language-Action) integration
- Future: Kubernetes operator for enterprise
