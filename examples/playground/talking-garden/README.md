# 🌱 The Talking Garden

Plants that communicate through a poetic robot narrator. Sensors translate plant needs into spoken poetry and gentle robot care.

## Concept

A greenhouse where every plant has a voice. Moisture, light, and temperature sensors feed into an AI poet that translates plant states into beautiful, emotional language. Robots respond by tending to the plants' needs.

**The vision:** Plants aren't silent - we just haven't been listening properly.

## How It Works

```
Plant Sensors → State Analysis → Poetic Translation → Robot Care
     ↓              ↓                  ↓                ↓
  Moisture     Thirsty?        "I dream of rain..."   Watering
  Light        Dark?           "The shadows grow..."  Move to sun
  Temp         Cold?           "Winter in my roots"   Heat lamp
```

## Example Poetry

> *"The fern whispers: My fronds thirst for silver dew,
>  Roots dreaming of cloud-kissed mountain streams..."*
